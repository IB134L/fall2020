####FILLING OUT THE STATES.CSV FILE#########

Kingdom:
Phylum level of a species can be found from here: 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy

For example in the document SltxB_states.csv:
Cell 2A indicates 'Burkholderia ambifaria'
Look it up in NCBI Taxonomy:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=152480

Write under Kingdom "Proteobacteria"
Any species with the word "synthetic"/"artificial" can be written as "NA" or "Other"
All insects or animals will be "Metazoan"


For the cell Lifestyle, this will require a brief Google/ Google scholar search of the species to figure out what/where the species usually lives.
Usually I will do a Google search to quickly figure out the organism's deal.
e.g. Burkholderia ambifaria top hit
https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/portal/bura6/bura6.home.html
says "Burkholderia ambifaria is generally found as the dominant Burkholderia cepacia complex species in natural environments where it is often associated with plant roots."
I think we should have the following options for Lifestyle:


Mammals (like E. coli living in human guts or cattle)
Soil
Plant Roots
Plant Leaves
Insect (if they live in an insect like Hamiltonella defensa, or ARE an insect)


Then, a citation will be necessary. Just writing in the title + last name of first author will be great, as I will reformat later depending on journal.

If you're uncertain, please just leave it empty and I will fill in later!
